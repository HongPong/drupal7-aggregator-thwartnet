Drupal 7 Aggregator based on Thwart.net

***************************************

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/HongPong/drupal7-aggregator-thwartnet
Derived from: http://thwart.net

Thwart.net is currently a test project Twitter aggregator which grabs Tweets
containing certain keywords and saves each tweet as a new Drupal node. This
uses a few modules to grab those feeds.

Every bit of code in this I believe is GPL licensed and for any fresh code these are
also GPL.

Developed by everyone in the Drupal community who created the modules.
This setup developed by Dan Feidt (hongpong) - hongpong@hongpong.com
Drupal.org: hongpong


***************************************
SETUP

- Refer to standard Drupal 7 installation. -> INSTALL.txt . Configure the database
  as normally etc.
- note that Administrator role isn't really set with permissions yet, so via UID1:
- Fill in unique site settings such as site name, valid site email address etc
- Once the site is running, then enable the Features module and the subsequent
  Features-derived modules:
- enable thwart_features_setup inside sites/all/modules/custom - should kick it in
- Be sure to set cron to run aggressively every 5 minutes or so
- go to yoursite.com/import and indicate which URLs you want to keep scraping from
- fire the scraper up, it should keep going on cron runs perpetually
- watch the log to see if things are erroring out or etc

NOTE: the included derivative theme 'thwart' is suitable for CSS modification.
It is based on Zen 5.x theme.
