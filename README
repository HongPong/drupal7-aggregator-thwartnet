Drupal 7 Aggregator based on Thwart.net

***************************************

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/HongPong/drupal7-aggregator-thwartnet
Derived from: http://thwart.net

Thwart.net is currently a test project Twitter aggregator which grabs Tweets containing
certain keywords and saves each tweet as a new Drupal node. This uses a few modules to
grab those feeds.

Every bit of code in this I believe is GPL licensed and for any fresh code these are
also GPL.

Developed by everyone in the Drupal community who created the modules.
This setup developed by Dan Feidt (hongpong) - hongpong@hongpong.com Drupal.org: hongpong
